# Collection of PDE problems and FEniCS models

The goal of this repository is to archive some FEM models. The concept is to introduce well documented models which could be useful.

They are separated in different "fronts" according with the nature of the physical problem:
  1. Heat Transfer
  2. CFD
  3. Continuum Mechanics
  4. Other
  
*Maybe* useful information will be stored in the Wiki.
