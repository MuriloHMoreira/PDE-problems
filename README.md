# Collection of PDE problems and FEniCS models

The goal of this repository is to archive some FEM models. The concept is to introduce well documented models which could be useful.

They are separated in different "fronts" according with the nature of the physical problem:
  1. Heat Transfer
  2. CFD
  3. Continuum Mechanics
  4. Other
  
*Maybe* useful information will be stored in the Wiki.


**Disclaimer:** This repository intends to be a study guide. Any information might be incorrect due to wrong interprations of the bibliography. Any information should be double checked. The outcome should be a good set of well documented examples for undergraduate students starting to study PDE's. Any help will be greatly appritiated.
