Numerical Solutions To PDE's via FEniCS

The goal of this repository is to archive some FEM models.

They are separated in different "fronts" according with the nature of the physical problem:
  1. Heat Transfer
  2. CFD
  3. Continuum Mechanics
  4. Other
  
*Maybe* useful information will be stored in the Wiki.
